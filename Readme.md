{Lisa}`s Manual of Me
Hello, I`d describe myself as ...
•	Bubbly
•	Persistent (if I want sth I am going to persue it, no matter how long it takes and how much I need to invest)
•	Straightforward
 
I do my very best work when ...
I am motivated and not hungry or sleepy.
 
My current working patterns are ...
•	Different, I like to work with people, but also alone while listening to music, eating and stretching
•	I need breaks but I also don’t 
 
I prefer communicating in these ways ...
•	via zoom, slack, text messages anything, just specify the method and speak or write 

 
When receiving feedback, it’s important that ...
•	I don’t mind if it is straighforward and I don’t need any sugar coating, but the feedback has to be constructive and not overly negative or aggressive
•	What do I mean with constructive? The feedback hast to include:
•	What am I doing now and what should I do in the future?
•	It needs to be specific and quantifably not”ugly” but “small 3px” “round”
•	Keep it short and doable, I cannot change everything at once but I am willing to change my ways if necessary but…
•	…don’t hold back! NOTHING worse than feeling a vibe and not getting any Feedback.


 
When I’m stressed, the best way to support me is ...
•	Give me food
•	Let’s talk a bit about cephalopods, they are awesome (monotrema as well)
•	Talk calmly and don’t focus on the bad things
 
These are some things going on outside of work which are ...
•	If I am  not insufferably ill (like right now, lol) I have Wushu-Training on:
•	Monday
•	Thursday
•	Friday
•	And need to leave at 17:30 and eat food at about 16:00, I am back at 21:00

 
Useful and helpful for to you to know ...
•	I have low blood sugar and I sometimes need to eat to keep it up

 
Others say that I’m ...

•	talking fast and I cannot bear it when others are talking very slowly
•	That leads to me interrupting people and some people feel that I don’t value their opinion but I do value everybodys opinion! It is just that I am already finishing the sentence in my head 10 sec prior to the person finishing it in reality
•	Please tell me if you do feel I am impolite in my speaking patterns!
•	I sometimes jump in my topics, tell me if I am too fast, you do not see how the topics are connected or when I am digressing! You can interrupt me anytime, I do not think that this is impolite by any means
•	Can come across as conceited to some people, but I am actually easily excited and that can lead to confusion. I love to talk about knowledge and I am curious and strongly believe that everybody can learn anything!
